In NS3, the simulation stops when one of the following conditions is met:

1. **Explicitly Stopping the Simulation:** You can stop the simulation explicitly by calling the `Simulator::Stop()` function. This is commonly done when you want to end the simulation at a specific time or after a certain number of events have been processed.

2. **All Events Processed:** If there are no more events left in the event queue, the simulation will automatically stop. This typically occurs when all scheduled events, such as packet transmissions or application activities, have been processed.

3. **No More Applications or Connections:** If all applications and connections in the simulation have completed their activities or have been explicitly stopped, the simulation will stop.

4. **Timeout:** You can set a global simulation time limit using `Simulator::Stop(Time limit)`, and the simulation will stop once that time limit is reached.

5. **Custom Termination Conditions:** You can implement custom termination conditions using callback functions or event handlers. For example, you can define a function to check specific metrics, and if those metrics meet certain criteria, you can call `Simulator::Stop()` to end the simulation.
